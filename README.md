# Sunset Notice

This journey has reached its end. We thank everyone who was a part of Athena for their invaluable contributions to this project. 

# Athena V1.0

Athena is a service to allow people to discover events, competitions and conferences based on their interests, rather than their existing social circle.

If you have any concerns or have any suggestions as to how we can do better, do let us know at

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. 

- You will need Angular 8

- Mongo [Only needs to be installed for developmental purposes]

```
npm install -g @angular/cli

```

### Installing

1. Open two different terminals
2. Navigate to the frontend folder in one terminal, and the backend folder in another terminal 
3. In the frontend terminal, run the following commands

```
npm install
ng serve

```

Do not worry if either of the commands take some time, it is absolutely okay. 
	4. Then, in the terminal where the backend folder is open run the following commands

```
npm install
node app.js

```

In the first terminal, you should have an output saying that the project has successfully compiled and is being run on localhost:4200
