# Sunset Notice

This journey has reached its end. We thank everyone who was a part of Athena for their invaluable contributions to this project. 

# Athena V1.0

If you're a student in India, you've probably had struggles with consolidating your achievements and awards and finding events that you can attend, based on your interests. 

By this project, we hope to create a space for budding young minds in order to get as much exposure as possible and to also provide them with a space where they can consolidate their achievements. 

If you have any concerns or have any suggestions as to how we can do better, do let us know at
